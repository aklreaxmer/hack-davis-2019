HackDavis entry: Research Portal - a website to connect undergraduates interested in research with the appropriate faculty, and vice versa


We created a website to link students searching for research positions to faculty. Students can create accounts and query labs that suit their particular interests. Students can leave their thoughts and what their activities were about labs they were in. Faculty can create announcements about open positions and send to students, which will be filtered based on what students select as their interests. The ultimate goal is to make it easier for students to find labs and for faculty to find qualified undergraduates. This code is built with Python, Flask, and Bootstrap
